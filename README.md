# MODE-D-for-sparse-feature-learning
This project uses MODE/D method to optomize mosfl model. The mosfl model is based on AE model which can help to generate primary parameters
through Multiobjective Optomization Difference Evolution algorithm. The sparse feature learning will help to reduce amount of parameters, as
well as speeding up convergence.
